There are surprisingly many definitions of the term Geographic Information System (GIS). There are even those who take the acronym GIS to mean Geographic Information Science.

Often, the tools are organised into a coherent desktop processing environment, such as [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Interactive Applications/Desktop GIS/QGIS/index|QGIS]] or [[ArcGIS pro]]. But a GIS can also consist of a programming environment such as [[JupyterLab]], typically in the programming language [[Python]], using a series of common [[Geospatial Libraries]]
There are many GISs out there, and [[Geospatial Technology Stack/index]] is often a hard job
Closely related to the term GIS are the terms [[Concepts/SemanticGIS/GIS project]], which is a project that uses GIS to solve Geospatial problems and [[Geoinformatics]], which is the science of geospatial processing and its application
