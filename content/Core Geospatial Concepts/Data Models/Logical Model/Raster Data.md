It is common to distinguish between two basic methods of geospatial data representation, namely [[Vector Data|vector]] and raster representations.

## Raster for [[Entity-based modelling]]

## Raster for [[Field-based modelling]]
Raster for field-based models are in semanticGIS named Digital Field Models (DFM). In other sources, they may be named DEM (Digital Elevation Models). We, however, try to refrain from this terminology since they represent other properties than elevation, and the term therefor is misleading.
