  - Core Geospatial Concepts
---
 In this folder, you will find articles on a fundamental building block, concept, or analytical method that is intrinsic to geospatial science, e.g., Vector/Raster Models, Projections, Map Algebra, and Spatial Autocorrelation. This section only contains general theory, meaning that you will find articles on  "Spatial Autocorrelation" and Tobler's first law of geography, but the specific operations/indices are described in the section on the  [[Geospatial Operations/index|SemanticGIS Pipeline language]]
