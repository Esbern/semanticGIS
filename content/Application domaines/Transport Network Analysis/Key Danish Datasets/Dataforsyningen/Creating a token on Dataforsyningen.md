In order to access [[Geographical Web Services]]  from dataforsyningen either directly as WMS etc, or through the QGIS plugin, you need a token A token is a long text code that represents a combination of username and password. One user can have many tokens and you can use them for different purposes If you think someone else is using your token you can delete that token and create a new one without having to change your username and password. To create a token login to dataforsyningen if you are not already logged in.
