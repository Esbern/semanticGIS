Often, the tools are organised into a coherent desktop processing environment, such as [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Platforms & Applications/Desktop GIS/QGIS/index|QGIS]] or [[ArcGIS pro]]. But a GIS can also consist of a programming environment such as [[JupyterLab]], typically in the programming language [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Programming Languages & Libraries/Languages/Python/index]], using a series of common [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Programming Languages & Libraries/Libraries/index]]
There are many GISs out there, and [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Platforms & Applications/index]] is often a hard job
Closely related to the term GIS are the terms [[Frameworks & Context/GIS project]], which is a project that uses GIS to solve Geospatial problems and [[Geoinformatics]], which is the science of geospatial processing and its application
