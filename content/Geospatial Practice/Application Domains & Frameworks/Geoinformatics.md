**Geoinformatics** is a term commonly used in Europe to describe the interdisciplinary field that encompasses the collection, analysis, and interpretation of geographic data. While similar to the American term **Geographic Information Science (GIScience)**, geoinformatics carries a slightly broader connotation. Like informatics, it emphasises not only the technical aspects of managing and analysing spatial data but also the application of these techniques within societal contexts.

Geoinformatics integrates various technologies, including [[GIS]], [[Remote Sensing]], and GPS, with computer science and data management to solve real-world problems. It is particularly focused on the practical application of these tools in areas such as urban planning, environmental management, and disaster response, ensuring that geospatial data and analysis contribute directly to decision-making and policy development.
