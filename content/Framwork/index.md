# Welcome to the SemanticGIS Framework
The core of semanticGIS is a structured [[Design Rationale]] that guides the user from a vague question to a defensible answer. This process forces a deliberate and documented approach at every stage.

1. Problem Framing & Conceptual Model: Define the problem's scope and the real-world entities involved. The user articulates their understanding of the task, clarifies key terms, and identifies the relevant concepts (e.g., 'suitable habitat', 'service area') that form the project's conceptual foundation.
    
2. Data Selection & The Domain of Discourse: Identify and justify the specific datasets used to represent the conceptual entities. This crucial step translates the abstract conceptual model into a concrete, machine-readable Domain of Discourse, forcing a critical evaluation of data suitability, limitations, and necessary transformations.
    
3. The Abstract Analytical Approach: Deconstruct the problem into a sequence of software-agnostic spatial operations (e.g., Buffer, Intersect, Zonal Statistics). This high-level "recipe" is documented formally, allowing it to be visualized, debated, and refined before any software is opened. This is the single source of truth for the analysis.
    
4. Dissemination and Communication: Plan and justify the final presentation of results. This step considers the target audience and the most effective medium (e.g., interactive web map, static report, dashboard) to ensure the findings are communicated with clarity and impact.

If your are new to SemanticGIS it is important that you start be reading the guide on writing a [[Design Rational]]. This guide also acts as a guide to the entire process of working through a [[GIS project]].
