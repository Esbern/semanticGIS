## Global datasets
### [[OpenStreetMap]]. 
In OSM, addresses can be represented in different ways reflecting the regional traditions, see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Addresses.
In general there are two different approaches 
1. Addresses are addes as nodes with tag `addr:housenumber` 
2. Alternatively, the attribute can be assigned as an attribute to the building. Please note this can be confusing in situations wher there are several addresses (enterances and flats) in the same building
