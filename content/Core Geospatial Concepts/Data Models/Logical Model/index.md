The Logical moddel is how the data is presentet to the user ther are two key tgyes namely 
	1. [[Raster Data]]
	2. [[Vector Data]]
Although [[Entity-based modelling]] is often  preserved as [[Vector Data|vector data]] and [[Field-based modelling]] is preserved as [[Raster Data|raster data]] this is not a absolut, Ther are many applications where representing [[Entity-based modelling]] as raster is the natural choice, especially if the enteties are derived form satellite data through a classification process. like wise [[Field-based modelling]] is often represented as measurement points or isolines using [[Vector Data|vector data]]
