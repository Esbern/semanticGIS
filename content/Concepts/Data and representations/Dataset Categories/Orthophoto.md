 A **Orthophoto (or Orthophotograph)**:  Is an aerial photo that has been geometrically corrected (“orthorectified”) so that the scale is uniform, like a map. Orthophotos eliminate the distortions found in regular aerial photos, making distances and measurements accurate.
An **Aerial Photo**:  Refers to any photograph taken from an aircraft, drone, satellite or other flying object. It provides a bird’s-eye view of the terrain but is not necessarily corrected for distortions like perspective or scale. Aerial photos often have geometric distortions because of the camera angle or elevation.
For Areal Photos to be used with other data layers in a [[Concepts/SemanticGIS/GIS]] they need not only to be orthorectified but also assigned a coordinate system. This is typically done in one process named [[Georeferencing]] to be
