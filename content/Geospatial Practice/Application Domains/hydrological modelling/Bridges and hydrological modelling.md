title: Bridges and hydrological modelling

One of the main sources of errors in hydrological modelling is bridges. The problem is that terrain models often are generated from Lidar scanning of the surface, resulting in the bridge being represented as the surface. In practice, this means that the bridge functions as a dam in the hydrological model. To ensure correct hydrological modelling, it is common to create [[Hydrologically Moddeling]] where bridges are removed.
