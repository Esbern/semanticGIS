At the heart of semanticGIS is a desire to establish new **geospatial practices** that focus on a structured, transparent, and well-documented process. This semanticGIS **geospatial practice** consists of:

1. A structuring of the [[Frameworks & Context/GIS project|GIS project]] into five well-defined phases as described in the section [[Geospatial Practice/index#The five phases of the GIS-project|The five phases of the GIS-project]] bellow.
2. A set of recommendations for good [[Geospatial Practice/Project Stewardship/index|Project Stewardship]], with the use of a [[Geospatial Practice/Project Stewardship/Design rationale|Design rationale]] being the most important.
It is always advisable to study other projects and domain-specific considerations; therefore, this part of the website also contains links to a series of [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data foundation/Application Domains/index|Application domains]]
## The five phases of the GIS-project
Within the SemanticGIS framework, we recommend that you organise your geospatial practice into the following five phases.
#### **1. [[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index|Project Scoping]]**

This is the foundational phase where you move from a vague idea to a concrete plan. You define your research questions, establish clear objectives, identify your area of interest, and outline the project's scope and limitations in your Design Rationale.

#### **2. [[Geospatial Practice/Data Modelling/index|Data Modelling]]**

Before you collect any data, you design your conceptual **ontology**â€”the formal "rulebook" that defines the objects, features, and relationships you will be working with. This crucial step ensures your data will be consistent and fit for purpose.

#### **3. [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data Foundation/index|Establishing the Data Foundation]]**

Here, you acquire and prepare your data. Whether you're conducting fieldwork, downloading existing datasets, or digitizing historical maps, every action is guided by your data model and meticulously documented in your Design Rationale.

#### **4. [[Geospatial Practice/Analytical Modelling/index|Analytical Modelling]]**

This is where you execute your analytical methods to answer your research questions. By linking your analysis directly to the preceding phases, you ensure that your results are grounded in a clear and logical workflow, not just a series of disconnected tool operations.

#### **5. [[Geospatial Practice/Dissemination and Communication/index|Dissemination and Communication]]**

The final phase involves sharing your work. This includes not only your final maps and reports but the **Design Rationale itself**. By publishing your process, you empower others to understand, critique, and confidently build upon your findings, fostering a culture of open and reproducible science.


## Exploitative Workflow vs Prescriptive Workflow 
Note that the execution of five phases is not 100 % linear like a  [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) within [[SemanticGIS]] there is considerable back flow form one phase to the privies.  This is especially the case if the "Project Scoping" has identified a "[[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index#^Prescriptive-Workflow|Prescriptive Workflow]]"  where we the project workflow till be identified by revers engineering the prescribed outputs
