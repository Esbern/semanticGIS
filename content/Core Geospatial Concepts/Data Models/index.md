 The standard hierarchy is:

1. **Conceptual Model (The "Thinking"):** The highest level of abstraction. This is where the **entity-based** and **field-based** views of the world live.
    
2. **Logical Model (The "Structuring"):** The implementation of the conceptual model in formal structures. This is where the **vector** (points, lines, polygons) and **raster** (grids) data models belong.
    
3. **Physical Model (The "Storing"):** The actual files and database schemas on disk. This refers to the technologies in our `Geospatial Technology Stack` like **GeoPackage**, **Shapefile**, and **PostGIS**.
