# From Observation to Data: A Framework for Capturing Reality

Disclaimer:
According to [Immanuel Kant](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant), we can never observe reality as "Ding an sich" or [noumenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon). Our process always begins with **Observation**: the act of perceiving **phenomena**â€”the objects, events, or signals that appear to our senses or instruments, _before_ we have assigned them a formal meaning.

## From Observation to Recording
While we can **observe** countless phenomena, we cannot map, enumerate, or analyse them in a structured way without an **Ontology** defined as as Domain of Discource or at least as a Univers of Discource (See phase 1 and 2 of the [[Design Rationale]]). An ontology is the formal "rulebook" that allows us to move from "unstructured" observation to "structured" **Recording**â€”the process of creating data.

The concepts of "unstructured" observation and "structured" Recording are at each end of a continuum defined by how well-defined (scoped) our ontology is. In practice, we rarely operate at the extreme ends of this continuum, but rather somewhere in between, depending on the project's purpose and current state.

Large projects with many participants, running over more extended periods, typically require more well-defined ontologies to ensure consistency between individuals and over time, compared to a single-person, one-off survey. Strictly speaking, we are not even able to verbalise our observations without a loose, culturally defined ontology.

Even a well-thought-through ontology (DoD), rarely survives contact with the complexity of observed phenomena. This is why a pilot study ðŸ§ª is essential. It is an iterative process where you test your recording rules in the field, discovering ambiguities and refining your schema. This crucial step ensures that your final ontology is not only theoretically sound but also practically robust, enabling a consistent and meaningful recording of your observations. Far too many projects suffer from having to change their ontology after data recording has started, and find themselves in the dilemma of having to scrap and redo the first part of the data recording or try (seldom successfully to modify the observations to match the new ontology.)

1. [[Recording reality|Chose how we want to observe reality]]
2. Observe reality.
3. Create the data structure needed torepresent our observations in GIS
4. Enter the observations into the GIS
