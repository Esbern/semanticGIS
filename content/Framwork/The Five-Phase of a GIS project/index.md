  - The Five-Phase of a GIS project

The methodology of `SemanticGIS` is built around three interconnected concepts:
1. A structuring of a [[GIS project]] into five well-defined phases
2. Documenting the [[GIS project]] through the use of a [[Design Rationale]]
3. Structuring the analytical process through the use of  a domains specific language.
This article focuses on the five phases of the [[GIS project]], these five phases are named after the primary intellectual task undertaken in each phase and function as a way to isolate the tasks, allowing for a focused and well-documented intellectual process.
The five phases are:
- [[1 Project Scoping]]
- [[2 Data Modelling]]
- 

	   

### 1.4 Analytical Approach
In this phase, you deconstruct the problem into spatial operations and analytical steps. Document which GIS methods and tools you use (e.g., buffering, density analysis, spatial joins), and why you selected these over alternatives. Discuss how your operations align with the problem as defined in your conceptual ontology.
    
### 1.5 Dissemination and Communication
Finally, you explain how you choose to present your findings. Consider who your audience is (e.g., the public, policymakers, clients), and how your choice of maps, visuals, or text will shape their understanding. Justify your medium (e.g., interactive map, printed report) and design choices in terms of clarity, accessibility, and impact.
