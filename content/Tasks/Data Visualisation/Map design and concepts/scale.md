 [[Geospatial data]], as such, do not have a scale but can have a level of detail that makes them relevant for visualisation at a given scale. So, the scale relates only to the scale of a visualisation. On a visualisation (Map), you have different options to specify the scale depending on your audience
 Scale as text i.e. one cm on the map equals 250 meters
 Scale a ratio (numeric) i.e 1:10.000
 Scale as a scale bar
Remember that some [[Projection]] do not allow the same scale over the entire map
