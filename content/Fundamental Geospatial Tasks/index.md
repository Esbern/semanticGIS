# Fundamental Geospatial Tasks
As statet in the text in what is [[GIS]]. I prefer a definition of the term that states that GIS is:

"A collection of typically (computer-based) tools focused on collecting, analysing, visualising, storing, editing and managing [[Geospatial data]]"

Form this follows that the fundamental Geospatial Tasks are:
## Collecting geospatial data
We here use the term Collecting rather broadly as covering both generating new data through observations and acquiring and transforming  existing data for the specific task.
