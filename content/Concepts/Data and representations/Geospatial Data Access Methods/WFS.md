#### Web Feature Services (WFS)

Web Feature Service (WFS) is an interface standard for exchanging geospatial data on the web. Unlike simple geocoding, WFS allows for more advanced operations such as querying, retrieving, and manipulating vector features. It supports the following operations:

- **GetFeature**: Retrieve geometries and attributes of spatial features.
- **DescribeFeatureType**: Describe the structure of feature types.
- **Transaction**: Insert, update, or delete features on the server.

WFS is widely used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for advanced spatial data management. For example, a city planning department might use WFS to manage and share data about roads, zoning, and utilities. By allowing real-time updates and queries, WFS facilitates dynamic and interactive GIS applications.
