2. **[[Core Geospatial Concepts/Data Models/Logical Model/index|logical model]] (The "Structuring"):** The implementation of the conceptual model in formal structures. This is where the **vector** (points, lines, polygons) and **raster** (grids) data models belong
3. **Physical Model (The "Storing"):** The actual files and database schemas on disk, like **GeoPackage**, **Shapefile**, and **PostGIS**. This is described in the [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Data Storage & Formats/Index|Data Storage & Formats]] section of the [[Geospatial Technology Stack/index|Geospatial Technology Stack]].
