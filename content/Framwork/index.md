# Welcome to the SemanticGIS Framework


# The `semanticGIS` Framework

The `semanticGIS` framework provides a structured methodology for conducting transparent and repeatable geospatial analysis. It is built on three core components: a five-phase project structure, a comprehensive documentation protocol, and a formal language for defining your analysis.

## 1. The Five-Phase Project Process Workflow Workflow

Every project is structured into five distinct phases, moving logically from the initial question to the final dissemination. This process provides a clear roadmap for your work, ensuring all critical steps are addressed systematically.

## 2. The Design Rationale üìì

The **Design Rationale** is the "lab notebook" for your project. It is a structured document where you record every decision, assumption, and process from start to finish. This practice ensures your work is transparent, auditable, and easily understood by others.

## 3. The Abstract-First Pipeline (DSL) üîó

We use a simple, human-readable Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to define the analytical workflow _before_ implementing it in any specific GIS software. This **abstract recipe** is the single source of truth for your analysis and can be used to automatically generate several outputs:

- **Mermaid Flowcharts** for visualizing the logical steps.
    
- **Step-by-step Recipes** for desktop GIS software (e.g., QGIS).
    
- **Executable Python Scripts** for automated processing.
