There are surprisingly many definitions of the term Geographic Information System (GIS). There are even those who take the acronym GIS to mean Geographic Information Science. 
The main decide in the definitions of GIS is between the definitions that see GIS as referring to a collection of software tools or as s collection of hardware, software, data, people, and methods.  Today (2025) most people adopt the the first definition e.g [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) and  [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview) while both organisations until the late 1990 use a variant of the latter definition

Within the SemanticGIS project we use the following definition:
A **Geographic Information System (GIS)** is a collection of computer-based tools focused on [[Establishing the Data foundation|collecting]], analysing, visualising, storing, editing, and managing [[Glossary/Geospatial Data|Geospatial data]]. ^gis-definition

To avoid any confusion we prefer to use the therm "geospatial engine" 
Often, the tools are organised into a coherent desktop processing environment, such as [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Platforms & Applications/Desktop GIS/QGIS/index|QGIS]] or [[ArcGIS pro]]. But a GIS can also consist of a programming environment typically  in the programming language [[Python]], using a series of common [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Platforms & Applications/Programming Languages & Libraries/Libraries/index]]. Especialy in a Scientific context the python code in embedded in a execution environment like [[JupyterLab]], or [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
There are many tools to chose for in the  [[GIS-garden/Geospatial Technology Stack/index|Geospatial Technology Stack]] and finding the right combination of tools to constityte the geopatial often a hard job
Closely related to the term GIS are the terms [[GIS-garden/Concepts/SemanticGIS/GIS project]], which is a project that uses GIS to solve Geospatial problems and [[Geoinformatics]], which is the science of geospatial processing and its application
