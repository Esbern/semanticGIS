There are surprisingly many definitions of the term Geographic Information System (GIS). There are even those that take the acronym GIS to mean Geographic Information Science. 

I prefer to **define GIS** as:
	"A collection of typically (computer-based) tools focused on collecting, analysing, visualising, storing, editing and managing [[Geospatial data]]"

Often, the tools are organised into a coherent desktop processing environment, such as [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Interactive Applications/Desktop GIS/QGIS/index|QGIS]] or [[ArcGIS pro]]. But a GIS can also consist of a programming environment such as [[JupyterLab]], typically in the programming language [[Python]], using a series of common [[Geospatial Libraries]]
There are many GISs out there, and [[Geospatial Technology Stack/index]] is often a hard job
Closely related to the term GIS are the terms [[GIS project]], which is a project that uses GIS to solve Geospatial problems and [[Geoinformatics]], which is the science of geospatial processing and its application
