**Place, Narrative & Context**  is a pattern  that uses spatial technologies like GIS to study and visualise relationships between space, place, and human culture, history, and behaviour.  It combines methods from the humanities (such as history, literature, and archaeology) with geographical tools and spatial analysis to gain new perspectives on cultural development, historical events, and human experiences over time. This field creates interactive maps, visualizations, and immersive environments to represent and analyze complex humanistic data in a spatial context
## Describing the Spatial configuration
In ethnography, understanding and describing the **spatial configuration** where the studied activities take place is crucial. One of the simplest and most effective ways to achieve this is by using a **[[General-purpose Map]]** such as [[OpenStreetMap]] to provide a geographical context. On such maps, key locations and activities can be marked to help visualise the spatial relationships and movements within the study area.

For studies focused on smaller or highly localised areas, the use of an [[Orthophoto]] as a reference can be highly beneficial. Orthophotos provide a more precise, real-world view of the physical environment, allowing for the documentation of subtle details, such as building layouts, vegetation, desire lines or the exact positioning of objects within the landscape. This level of detail can be especially valuable in understanding how physical space influences social interactions and behaviours.

Alternatively, the General-purpose Map can be enriched with additional layers of information to make it more relevant to the ethnographic context. For instance, urban features, areas dominatet by shade from surrounding buildings, or other elements that shape the environment can be added. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how the physical setting interacts with the social activities being studied, offering insight into the spatial dynamics that influence everyday life.


### **Describing the Spatial Character (Genius Loci)**

In addition to describing the physical arrangement of space, ethnographic studies often benefit from capturing the **spatial character** or **genius loci**—the inherent atmosphere or unique quality of the environment itself. While spatial configuration refers to the placement and arrangement of physical elements, the **spatial character** focuses on the **distinct qualities of the space** that exist independently of human activities.

Describing the **genius loci** means understanding the **natural and built features** that contribute to a place’s overall feel and identity. This could include aspects like:

- The **natural landscape**, such as rolling hills, open skies, dense forests, or water bodies that give the area a specific visual or ecological character.
- The **architectural style** or materials used in buildings and infrastructure that convey a particular historical or aesthetic quality.
- The **play of light and shadow**, whether created by natural sunlight or artificial lighting, that defines the mood of the space at different times of day.
- The **scale** and **proportions** of the space, such as whether the area feels open and expansive, or enclosed and intimate.
- **Weather conditions** or climate patterns that regularly shape the environment, like constant fog in a coastal town or the harsh brightness of a desert.
  
These features contribute to the **atmosphere of place** without the need for human interaction. They form the backdrop against which activities unfold, setting the tone and providing a passive influence on how the space might be used or perceived. For example, a dense, overgrown park with towering trees will carry a very different spatial character than an open, sunlit plaza, regardless of who might be present.

By focusing on these inherent characteristics, ethnographers can offer a deeper understanding of the **non-human** qualities of a place that influence the context of their study. The **spatial character** thus complements the analysis of human behavior by describing the **background qualities** of the environment that are constant, shaping but not directly part of the interactions being studied.
