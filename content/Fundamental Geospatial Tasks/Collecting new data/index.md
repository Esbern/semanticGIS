# From Observation to Data: A Framework for Capturing Reality

### Introduction: The Need for New Data

This framework is a direct continuation of our semanticGIS [[Design Rationale]].Â  Here, in [[Design Rationale#1. Problem Framing and Conceptual Ontology|step 1]], you have created a clear formulation of the problem to be addressed and created a conceptual ontology (universe of discourse). In  [[Design Rationale#2. Data Selection (Domain of Discourse)|Step 2]], you have investigated existing datasets to determine if they directly meet your needs or require some processing. If not, and you have arrived at the conclusion that data collection is necessary (always a last resort, as it is extremely time-consuming), this is where this document comes in and outlines four fundamental methods of observation. Your choice of method is not arbitrary; it is dictated by the nature of the entities within your chosen Domain of Discourse. 
It is practical to see the GIS-based representation of reality as a three-step journey:
1. Define how we see reality, (Step 1 and 2 in the [[Design Rationale]])
2. [[Observing reality|Chose how we want to observe reality]]
3. Observe reality.
4. Create the data structure needed torepresent our observations in GIS
5. Enter the observations into the GIS
