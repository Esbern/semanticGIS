# Geospatial Environment Setup

Welcome to the official setup instructions for the **RUC Geospatial Environment**, developed by Roskilde University. This environment is designed to support a variety of users including:

- University students in planning, environmental science, and geography
- Smallholder farmers and agricultural advisors
- Municipal staff working with spatial data
- Citizen science projects and community mapping groups

The environment is fully self-contained and includes tools for accessing spatial datasets tailored to your user type and current needs.

---

## ‚úÖ What This Setup Will Do

Once installed and launched, this geospatial environment will:

- Install QGIS in a controlled Conda environment (independent from any existing QGIS installs)
- Install essential Python packages for working with spatial data, including Parquet and DuckDB
- Let you choose your user type (e.g., student, farmer, municipality) on first run
- Download data and tools appropriate for your user type from a central configuration file on GitHub
- Maintain your personal settings (e.g., user type, login credentials) in a private `.env` file

> All operations are local to your computer. No system files are touched.
> You can delete the entire environment at any time with no side effects.

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install Miniforge

Visit the official site and download Miniforge for your operating system:
https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

Choose the version that matches your system (macOS Intel/ARM or Windows).

### 2. Download the GitHub Release

Go to the [Releases section of the project GitHub repo](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/RUCgeospatial/releases) and download the latest `.zip` file.

Unzip it somewhere convenient (e.g., your Documents folder).

### 3. Run the Setup Script

Open your terminal or command prompt:

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
cd path/to/unzipped/folder
bash scripts/install.sh
```

#### On Windows:
Double-click `scripts\install.bat` or run:
```cmd
cd path\to\unzipped\folder
scripts\install.bat
```

This will:
- Create a Conda environment called `qgis_env`
- Install QGIS, GDAL, DuckDB, and other packages
- Set up the local tool for downloading datasets based on your selected user type

### 4. Set Up Your `.env` File

On first use, the tool will prompt you to select your user type. It will then store your preferences in a file named `.env` in the project folder. This file may include:

```dotenv
USER_TYPE=student
USERNAME=your_username_here
PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

This file remains private and is never committed to GitHub.

## üöÄ Using the Tools

### Start QGIS
After setup, you can start QGIS using the provided launcher:

- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
bash scripts/start_qgis.sh
```

- On Windows:
```cmd
scripts\start_qgis.bat
```

### Run the Download Tool
You can also run the interactive dataset downloader:
```bash
conda activate qgis_env
streamlit run downloader/streamlit_app.py
```

This tool will:
- Detect your user type
- Fetch available datasets from GitHub
- Allow you to download and store them locally in a `data/` folder

---

## üßº Uninstalling
If you ever want to remove the environment, you can run:
```bash
conda remove --name qgis_env --all
```
And delete the project folder.

---

## üîÅ Environment Philosophy

We aim to keep everything in **a single Conda environment** (`qgis_env`) to avoid confusion. This makes it easier to update or add new tools. 

Only if there are package conflicts or highly specialized needs will additional environments be introduced ‚Äî and this will be clearly communicated.
