There are many software options for working with geospatial data, and which to choose depends on your purpose, skills and access to (license, institutional setup and money). 

### General purpose GIS.
For most beginners, I recommend a general-purpose solution, whether as a native app on your computer or as a web app. For historical reasons, general-purpose solutions for working with geospatial data are called Geographic Information Systems ([[Frameworks & Context/GIS]]). 

Typical applications:
- [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Platforms & Applications/Desktop GIS/QGIS/index|QGIS]]]
- [[ArcGIS pro]]

### Field Data Collection
Often, you need to collect your own geospatial data, and a typical approach would be to use some app on a mobile device (Phone or tablet). There are options; most of them are paid solutions since they typically involve some server the device connects to.  An alternative to a dedicated app is a website that enables spatial data entry.

Common applications
- [[survey123]]
- ArcGIS field Maps
- [[Qfield]] (There is a free version)
- [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/)

### 3D Modelling Software
This category of software transcends into the more architectural visualisation domain. This is a rather broad group of software and covers everything from creating 3D models from photos to creating photo realistic 3d scenes.

### Interactive Web Maps
We often need to present maps in an interactive form to a larger audience, so being able to publish maps on the internet is an important task. Like apps for data collection, these solutions are often not free since they rely on a server to host them. Some interactive map publishing possibilities double as web page editors and enable the creation of entire web pages with interactive maps and more.

### Python and Geospatial Data
The programming language Python is the all-dominating programming language when it comes to processing geospatial data. be it for automating and extending general purposes GIS apps or as a stand-alone environment. 

## Selecting the right environment for advanced geospatial analysis. 

When working with complex software  and especially programming environments that use multiple libraries setting up [[Advanced Environments for Geospatial Processing]] becomes very important
