The methodology of `SemanticGIS` is built around three interconnected concepts:
1. A structuring of a [[Frameworks & Context/GIS project]] into five well-defined phases
2. Documenting the [[Frameworks & Context/GIS project]] through the use of a [[Design Rationale]]
3. Structuring the analytical process through the use of  a domains specific language.
This article focuses on the five phases of the [[Glossary/GIS Project|GIS Project]], these five phases are named after the primary intellectual task undertaken in each phase and function as a way to isolate the tasks, allowing for a focused and well-documented intellectual process.

The five phases are:
1. [[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index]]
2. [[Geospatial Practice/Data Modelling/index]]
3. [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data foundation/index|Establishing the Data foundation]]
4. [[Geospatial Practice/Analytical Modelling/index]]
5. [[Dissemination and Communication]]

## Exploitative workflow vs Prescriptive Workflow 
Note that the execution of five phases is not 100 % linear like a  [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) within [[SemanticGIS]] there is considerable back flow form one phase to the privies.  This is especially the case if the "Project Scoping" has identified a "[[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index#^Prescriptive-Workflow|Prescriptive Workflow]]"  where we the project workflow till be identified by revers engineering the prescribed outputs
