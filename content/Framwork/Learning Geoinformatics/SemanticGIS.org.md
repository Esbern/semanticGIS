 There are basically 5 ways to navigate the site:
- The [[Design rational]] will guide you step by step through the GIS project. 
- Using the search area in the top left
- Use the folder structure "Explorer" under the search field. This fives the ability to navigate the folder structure of the notes. This approach is not recommended unless you are navigating to a topic you know where is located. (the folder location is also available as a breadcrumb over the note title)
- Tags: The tags associated with a note are listed under the note title. Clicking a tag will list all other notes with that tag
- Graph View (at the top right) shows a graph of the note and all other notes/tags with links to it.
