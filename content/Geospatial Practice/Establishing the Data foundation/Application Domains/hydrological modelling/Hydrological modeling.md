It seams it might be intresting to consider the differance betrwwn a static GIS based model like g.wathershead with mor dynamic modells where  percipitation can be varied is time and space.
It looks like [synxflow](https://synxflow.readthedocs.io) could be an intresting starting point.
Also [landlab](https://landlab.github.io/#/) has potential. Although landbab is more focused on landscape forming processes ther is a  tutorial including a video on using landlab for flooding modelling available at https://hatarilabs.com/ih-en/flood-simulation-from-direct-rainfall-with-python-and-landlab-tutorial
