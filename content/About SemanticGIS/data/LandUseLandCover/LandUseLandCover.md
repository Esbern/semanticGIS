- **Description:** This sphere encompasses data that classifies and maps the Earth's surface based on its **observed physical cover (land cover) and the human activities conducted upon it (land use).** It focuses on the spatial partitioning of the surface into distinct _thematic categories_ for inventory, analysis, and management, often serving as a comprehensive surface inventory.
- **Subclasses (Complexes):**
    - `landuselancover_classified_products`: Standard land cover and land use maps/datasets, where the surface is divided into thematic categories. This includes maps of forests, agricultural lands, urban areas, water bodies, bare land, and ice/snow _when classified as a land cover type_.
    - `landuselancover_change_monitoring`: Data specifically related to changes in land use and land cover over time (e.g., deforestation maps, urban sprawl statistics, LULC transition matrices, historical LULC datasets focused on change analysis).
    - `landuselancover_general_reference`: Multi-thematic, general-purpose maps and spatial databases that partition the surface for broad understanding or navigation (e.g., OpenStreetMap data, digitized topographical map sheets, historical general-purpose maps that show various land covers and features).
- **Common Overlaps & Distinctions:**
    - **Historical Aspect:** Datasets here are simply `classified_products` or `general_reference` maps. Their `temporal_coverage` metadata indicates if they are historical. There is no separate `_historical` subclass.
    - **Source Data:** LULC products are often derived from `toposphere_imagery` (remote sensing data), but the classified product (thematic categories) lives here.
    - **Beyond Biosphere:** This sphere explicitly holds classifications like "urban areas" and "ice/snow," which are not purely biological, resolving ambiguity from placing them in `Biosphere`.
    - **Human Activity:** Land _use_ inherently ties to `Socio-Technical` activities, while land _cover_ relates to `Biosphere`, `Hydrosphere`, `Pedosphere`, and `Lithosphere`. This sphere acts as a bridge, synthesizing elements from many others.
