Although Geospatial data Processing can be seen as a knowledge domain in its own right. Different application domains have their own traditions for which data and business logic (workflows) to use. Accessing the GIS garden through the Application domain paths can therefore, in some situations, be a useful approach.
Some of the highlighted  application domains are:
- [[Agriculture]]
- [[Energy planning]]
- [[3D urban visualisation and planning]]
- [[Environmental planning]]
- [[Public Transportation Analysis and Accessibility Planning]]
