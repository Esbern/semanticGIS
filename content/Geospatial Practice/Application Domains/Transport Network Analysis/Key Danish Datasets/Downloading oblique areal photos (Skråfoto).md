The official Danish collection of oblique areal images cab be accessed from https://skraafoto.dataforsyningen.dk/ However If you need a collection of images of a area for instance to create a 3D photogrammetric model see the note on [[Photogrammetry]] it is practical to be able to download all images covering a given [[Bounding Box]]. In odder to do this you need to access the API.  A general description of the data can be found at https://skraafoto.dataforsyningen.dk/info.html and the documentation for the STAC based API can be found at https://docs.dataforsyningen.dk/#skraafoto-stac-api-dokumentation- I have written a JupyterNotebook and associated docker image that demonstrates the use of the API In order to use the Notebook you need a user on Dataforsyning  (See [[Creating a user on Dataforsyningen]]) and a token  (See [[Creating a token on Dataforsyningen]])
