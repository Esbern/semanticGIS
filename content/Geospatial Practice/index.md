The methodology of `SemanticGIS` is built around three interconnected concepts:
1. A structuring of a [[Frameworks & Context/GIS project]] into five well-defined phases
2. Documenting the [[Frameworks & Context/GIS project]] through the use of a [[Glossary/Design rationale]]
3. Structuring the analytical process through the use of  a domains specific language.
This article focuses on the five phases of the [[Glossary/GIS Project|GIS Project]], these five phases are named after the primary intellectual task undertaken in each phase and function as a way to isolate the tasks, allowing for a focused and well-documented intellectual process.

The five phases are:
1. [[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index]]
2. [[Geospatial Practice/Data Modelling/index]]
3. [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data foundation/index|Establishing the Data foundation]]
4. [[Geospatial Practice/Analytical Modelling/index]]
5. [[Dissemination and Communication]]

## Exploitative workflow vs Prescriptive Workflow 
Note that the execution of five phases is not 100 % linear like a  [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) within [[SemanticGIS]] there is considerable back flow form one phase to the privies.  This is especially the case if the "Project Scoping" has identified a "[[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index#^Prescriptive-Workflow|Prescriptive Workflow]]"  where we the project workflow till be identified by revers engineering the prescribed outputs



- **The Five-Phase Process:** We believe every GIS project is a scientific endeavor. Our methodology guides you through five logical phases, ensuring that no critical step is overlooked. This process is the **"scientific method"** for your project.
    
- **The Design Rationale:** This is your project's non-negotiable **"lab notebook"** ðŸ““. It's a living document where you record every assumption, decision, dataset, and process. It is the single source of truth that makes your work completely transparent and defensible.

### The Five Phases of a `semanticGIS` Project

Our framework organizes the entire project lifecycle into five distinct, manageable phases.

#### **1. Project Scoping**

This is the foundational phase where you move from a vague idea to a concrete plan. You define your research questions, establish clear objectives, identify your area of interest, and outline the project's scope and limitations in your Design Rationale.

#### **2. Data Modelling**

Before you collect any data, you design your conceptual **ontology**â€”the formal "rulebook" that defines the objects, features, and relationships you will be working with. This crucial step ensures your data will be consistent and fit for purpose.

#### **3. Data Sourcing and Preparation**

Here, you acquire and prepare your data. Whether you're conducting fieldwork, downloading existing datasets, or digitizing historical maps, every action is guided by your data model and meticulously documented in your Design Rationale.

#### **4. Geospatial Analysis**

This is where you execute your analytical methods to answer your research questions. By linking your analysis directly to the preceding phases, you ensure that your results are grounded in a clear and logical workflow, not just a series of disconnected tool operations.

#### **5. Dissemination and Communication**

The final phase involves sharing your work. This includes not only your final maps and reports but the **Design Rationale itself**. By publishing your process, you empower others to understand, critique, and confidently build upon your findings, fostering a culture of open and reproducible science.
