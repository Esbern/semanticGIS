# Semantic GIS: Think First, Click Later.

GIS projects are often chaotic "black boxes," making them difficult to trust, reproduce, or build upon.  At the heart of semanticGIS is a desire to establish new [[Geospatial Practice/index|Geospatial Practices]] that focus on a structured, transparent, and well-documented process, from the first question to the final map. Through this process, your GIS project should become collaboration-friendly, trustworthy and portable.

### Our Approach: A new geospatial practice, Not Just a Tool 

In the section [[Geospatial Practice/index|Geospatial Practice]], we outline five clear phases your GIS project should go through, plus one overarching activity of [[Geospatial Practice/Project Stewardship/index|Project Stewardship]], of which maintaining [[Geospatial Practice/Project Stewardship/Design rationale|Design rationale]] is the key activity.
Although semanticGIS focuses on thought at some point, some buttons need to be clicked in order for the thoughts to manifest themselves. The section on the [[Geospatial Technology Stack/index|Geospatial Technology Stack]] contains an overview of and guides to the most common software components of a GIS-project.

## What next ?
The `semanticGIS` framework is a methodology for improving the rigor and transparency of geospatial research. For a comprehensive guide to its principles and implementation, please consult the [[index 2|framework documentation]]. To see the framework applied to a real-world problem, we invite you to explore our case studies from different [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data foundation/Application Domains/index|Application domains]].
