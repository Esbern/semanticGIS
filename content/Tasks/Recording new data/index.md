# From Observation to Data: A Framework for Capturing Reality

Disclaimer:
According to [Immanuel Kant](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant), we can never observe reality as "Ding an sich" or [noumenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon). Our process always begins with **Observation**: the act of perceiving **phenomena**â€”the objects, events, or signals that appear to our senses or instruments, _before_ we have assigned them a formal meaning.

## From Observation to Recording
While we can **observe** countless phenomena, we cannot map, enumerate, or analyze them in a structured way without an **Ontology**. An ontology is the formal "rulebook" that allows us to move from "unstructured" observation to "structured" **Recording**â€”the process of creating data.

The concepts of "unstructured" observation and "structured" Recording are at each end of a continuum defined by how well-defined (scoped) our ontology is. In practice, we never operate at the extreme ends of this continuum, but rather somewhere in between, depending on the purpose and state of our project.

Large projects with many participants, running over longer periods, typically require more well-defined ontologies to ensure consistency between individuals and over time, compared to a single-person, one-off survey. Strictly speaking, we are not even able to verbalize our observations without a loose, culturally defined ontology.

Before any practical recording begins, you must define your ontology. This establishes your domain of discourse and results in a formal classification schema. This goes beyond simply listing categories; it involves determining what constitutes a single, discrete feature. For instance, in observing a park, is a 'group on a bench' a single entity, or are the individual people the features of interest? The answer is driven directly by your scientific question.

A theoretical schema, however, rarely survives contact with the complexity of observed phenomena. This is why a pilot study ðŸ§ª is essential. It is an iterative process where you test your recording rules in the field, discovering ambiguities and refining your schema. This crucial step ensures your final ontology is not just theoretically sound but practically robust, enabling a consistent and meaningful recording of your observations.
### Introduction: The Need for New Data

This framework is a direct continuation of our semanticGIS [[Design Rationale]].Â  Here, in [[Design Rationale#1. Problem Framing and Conceptual Ontology|step 1]], you have created a clear formulation of the problem to be addressed and created a conceptual ontology ([[universe of discourse]]). In  [[Design Rationale#2. Data Selection (Domain of Discourse)|Step 2]], you have investigated existing datasets to determine if they directly meet your needs or require some processing. If not, and you have arrived at the conclusion that data collection is necessary (always a last resort, as it is extremely time-consuming), this is where this document comes in and outlines four fundamental methods of observation. Your choice of method is not arbitrary; it is dictated by the nature of the entities within your chosen Domain of Discourse. 
It is practical to see the GIS-based representation of reality as a three-step journey:
1. Define how we see reality, (Step 1 and 2 in the [[Design Rationale]])
2. [[Recording reality|Chose how we want to observe reality]]
3. Observe reality.
4. Create the data structure needed torepresent our observations in GIS
5. Enter the observations into the GIS
