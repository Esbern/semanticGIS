 According to the [ISO standard 19109:2015](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:19109:ed-2:v1:en), Geographic (geospatial) data is defined as data with **implicit** or **explicit** reference to a location relative to the Earth.^Geospatial-data-definition
In this context, we can think of the "data" as the **"what"** and the reference to a location relative to the Earth as the **where**. The **when** is also generally considered to be part of the data.
