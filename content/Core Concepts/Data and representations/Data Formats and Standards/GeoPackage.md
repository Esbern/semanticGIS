 The Geopackage is the default data format in [[SemanticGIS/Processing Environments/QGIS/index]] and is an [[Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)]] standard. Another advantage of the Geopackage format is that it really just is an SQLite database with spatial data. The advantage of this is that SQLite is an extremely common database format, and many other programs, including mobile apps, can read it. Although [[ArcGIS pro]] can read and write to the geopackage format the default format in the ESRI family is one of the [[geodatabase formats]]  )
