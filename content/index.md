# Semantic GIS: Think First, Click Later.

Modern GIS tools are incredibly powerful, but that power comes with a risk: it is all too easy for the "why" of your analysis to get lost in the "how." Without rigorous management, even the best-intentioned project can drift into a "black box" state—where the logic behind the map becomes invisible, making the results difficult to verify or reproduce.

**semanticGIS** establishes a new standard for [[Geospatial Practice/index|Geospatial Practice]]. We enforce this through Documentation Driven Development: prioritising the capture of your scientific intent before you execute a single operation. By explicitly defining your analytical pipeline in clear, human-readable terms, we ensure your project remains a transparent "glass box"—collaboration-friendly, trustworthy, and fully portable from the first question to the final map.

To support better [[Geospatial Practice/index|Geospatial Practice]], the system provides two core tools:

1. **[[Geospatial Operations/index|SemanticGIS Pipeline Language]]**: A tool for defining abstract analytical workflows.
    
2. **[[Geospatial Data Framework/index|Geospatial Data Framework]]**: A framework for modeling geospatial reality.
    

## Where to start?

We recommend a pragmatic approach to learning SemanticGIS:

1. **Learn the Method:** Start by reading the [[Geospatial Practice/index|Geospatial Practice]] guide to understand the five phases of the project lifecycle.
    
2. **See it in Action:** Explore the [[Geospatial Practice/Analytical Patterns/index|Application domains & Frameworks]] to see how these phases are implemented in real-world contexts.
