This is where you develop and execute analytical pipelines to answer your research questions. These pipelines take the data from the data structure created in the [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data Foundation/index|Establishing the Data foundation]] phase and process them so they are ready for [[Geospatial Practice/Dissemination and Communication/index|Dissemination and Communication]] It is thus a combination of the intellectual process of designing processing pipelines and a software-specific knowledge of how to implement these pipelines.
We supply two tools for supporting this phase:
 1. In the section [[Geospatial Practice/Analytical Modelling/Common Analytical Patterns/index|Common Analytical Patterns]], we supply some examples showing how different typical analytical models operate.
 2. We strongly recommend using [[The SemanticGIS pipeline Language/Index|the SemanticGIS pipeline Language]] to develop and document the process. 
 [[The SemanticGIS pipeline Language/Index|The SemanticGIS pipeline Language]] helps focus on the **Abstract-First Design Pattern**. It defines a _tool-agnostic, abstract pipeline_ that represents the pure **logic** of the analysis.
