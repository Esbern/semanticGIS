There are surprisingly many definitions of the term Geographic Information System (GIS). There are even those who take the acronym GIS to mean Geographic Information Science. 
The main decision in the definitions of GIS is between the definitions that see GIS as referring to a collection of software tools or as a collection of hardware, software, data, people, and methods.  Today (2025), most people adopt the first definition, e.g [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) and  [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview), while both organisations, until the late 1990, use a variant of the latter definition

Within the SemanticGIS project, we use the following definition:
A **Geographic Information System (GIS)** is a collection of computer-based tools focused on [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data Foundation/index|collecting]], analysing, visualising, storing, editing, and managing [[Geospatial data]]. ^gis-definition

Often, the tools are organised into a coherent desktop processing environment, such as [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Platforms & Applications/Desktop GIS/QGIS/index|QGIS]] or [[ArcGIS pro]]. But a GIS can also consist of a programming environment such as [[JupyterLab]], typically in the programming language [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Programming Languages & Libraries/Languages/Python/index]], using a series of common [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Programming Languages & Libraries/Libraries/index]]
There are many GISs out there, and [[Geospatial Technology Stack/Platforms & Applications/index]] is often a hard job
Closely related to the term GIS are the terms [[Frameworks & Context/GIS project]], which is a project that uses GIS to solve Geospatial problems and [[Geoinformatics]], which is the science of geospatial processing and its application
