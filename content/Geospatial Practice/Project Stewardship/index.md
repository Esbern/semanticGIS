 The key tool is the [[Design rationale|Design rationale]]. In the context of semanticGIS, I recommend maintaining the design rationale in a tool such as Jupyter Notebook, as it enables programmatic verification and visualisation of the process.
 In addition to the key [[Design rationale|Design rationale]], I recommend using tools like https://toggl.com/ for time keeping and following the guide on maintaining a [[GIS project]]. If the project involves more exotic tools i recommend taking a look at [[Advanced Environments for Geospatial Processing]] and [[A Beginner's Guide to Safely Installing Software]]
