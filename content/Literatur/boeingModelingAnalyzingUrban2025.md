> abstract:: OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design—in addition to the scientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.
