This is where you develop and execute analytical pipelines to answer your research questions. These pipelines take the data from the data structure created in the [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data Foundation/index|Establishing the Data foundation]] phase and process them so they are ready for [[Geospatial Practice/Dissemination and Communication/index|Dissemination and Communication]]  It is thus a combination of the intellectual process of designing processing pipelines and a software-specific knowledge of how to implement these pipelines.


If the [[Geospatial Operations/index|Geospatial Operations]] section provides the "ingredients" (like `Buffer` or `Intersect`), this section provides the **complete recipes** for common, reusable analyses.

This is where we practice our **Abstract-First Design Pattern**. The notes here don't just show _which buttons to click_. They first define a _tool-agnostic, abstract pipeline_ that represents the pure **logic** of the analysis.

The pipelines in this section (like [[Geospatial Practice/Application Domains & Frameworks/Digital hydrology/index|digital hydrology]] digital hydrology or suitability modeling) are our 'abstract' building blocks. In the `Application Domains` section, we will see how these same pipelines are compiled and applied to solve concrete, real-world problems.

As you use this section, focus on understanding _how_ a problem is deconstructed into a logical chain of operations. The goal is to build your own "design rationale"â€”the ability to explain _why_ you chose a specific pipeline and how it logically connects your data to your scientific question.
