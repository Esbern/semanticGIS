- **Description:** This sphere encompasses the Earth's unconsolidated material on the surface (soil), formed by the interaction of climate, organisms, relief, parent material, and time. It includes soil profiles, their physical, chemical, and biological properties, and dynamic processes. It is the biologically active interface where the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere extensively interact.
- **Subclasses (Complexes):**
    - `pedosphere_soil_properties`: Data describing specific physical, chemical, and biological attributes of soil (e.g., texture, pH, organic carbon content, bulk density, nutrient levels, intrinsic hydraulic conductivity).
    - `pedosphere_soil_types_mapping`: Categorical data on soil classification and distribution (e.g., national and regional soil maps, soil taxonomic units).
    - `pedosphere_soil_moisture_temperature`: Dynamic data related to water and heat content within soil profiles (e.g., soil moisture sensor readings, soil temperature probes).
    - `pedosphere_soil_erosion_sedimentation`: Data related to soil loss, deposition, and land degradation processes (e.g., erosion rates, sediment yield models, erodibility indices).
    - `pedosphere_contaminants`: Data on pollutants and contaminants present within the soil matrix (e.g., heavy metal contamination, pesticide residues, hydrocarbon spills in soil).
- **Common Overlaps & Distinctions:**
    - **Interface:** The `Pedosphere` is inherently an interface, strongly interacting with `Toposphere` (surface shape affecting soil), `Biosphere` (soil organisms, plant roots), `Hydrosphere` (soil moisture, groundwater recharge), `Atmosphere` (soil-air gas exchange), and `Lithosphere` (parent material).
    - **Agriculture:** While agricultural activity occurs on soil, the _classification of land as agricultural_ is in `landuselancover_classified_products`. _Agricultural yields_ are `socio_technical_resource_utilization`.
