- **Description:** This sphere encompasses all living organisms on Earth, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms, as well as their ecological communities and interdependencies. It focuses on life itself and the natural processes within ecosystems.
- **Subclasses (Complexes):**
    - `Vegetation`: Specific information about plant life (e.g., forest types, crop health indices like NDVI, species distribution of plants, primary productivity).
    - `Fauna`: Data on animal life (e.g., species distribution, population counts, wildlife corridors, bird migration routes, fish stock biomass). **Note:** This excludes general human population data.
    - `biosphere_microbial`: Data on microorganisms and their activity (e.g., soil microbes, aquatic bacteria, fungal networks, distribution of pathogens where the primary focus is the organism itself).
    - `biosphere_ecosystems`: Data representing ecological units and their characteristics (e.g., ecoregions, habitat types, biodiversity hotspots, ecosystem health metrics).
    - `biosphere_contaminants`: Data related to the presence of pollutants within living organisms or their accumulation in biological systems (e.g., bioaccumulation of heavy metals in fish, pesticide residues in plants, spread of diseases/pathogens _within non-human wildlife populations_).
