Within`semanticGIS`, we use the concept of **design rationale** as a practical tool to help you document and reflect on your GIS project work. Traditionally, the term is used in software and product design to describe decisions after they have been made (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_rationale)), we’re adapting it here for you to actively plan, document, and justify your decisions as you proceed. Think of it as a blend between a traditional _design rationale_ and a _research design_.

Like a research design, your rationale will help you plan your work step by step—defining your problem, identifying key concepts, selecting data, and choosing appropriate analytical methods. At the same time, like a traditional design rationale, the design rationale is used to reflect on your decisions, explain why you made them, and consider possible alternatives. This will strengthen your ability to communicate your work clearly to clients, collaborators, or your future self.
