At the heart of semanticGIS is a desire to establish **geospatial practices** that focus on a structured, transparent, and well-documented process. This semanticGIS **geospatial practice** consists of:
1. Structuring your [[GIS project|GIS project]] into five well-defined phases as described in the section [[Geospatial Practice/index#The five phases of the GIS-project|The five phases of the GIS-project]] below.
2. A set of recommendations for good [[Geospatial Practice/Project Stewardship/index|Project Stewardship]], where the use of a [[Geospatial Practice/Project Stewardship/Design rationale|Design rationale]] is the most important.
Especially if you are new to doing geospatial analysis, it is  advisable to study other projects and domain-specific considerations; therefore, this part of the website also contains links to a series of [[Geospatial Practice/Application Domains & Frameworks/index|Application domains & Frameworks]] that highlight how the [[Geospatial Practice/index#The five phases of the GIS-project|The five phases of the GIS-project]] can be implemented in different contexts.
## The five phases of the GIS-project
Within the SemanticGIS framework, we recommend that you organise your geospatial practice into the following five phases.
#### **1. [[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index|Project Scoping]]**

This is the foundational phase where you move from a vague idea (topic) to an actionable question. You define your research questions, establish clear objectives, identify your area of interest, and outline the project's scope and limitations.  

#### **2. [[Geospatial Practice/Data Modelling/index|Data Modelling]]**

Before you collect any data, you design your conceptual **ontology**â€”the formal "rulebook" that defines the objects, features, and relationships you will be working with. This crucial step ensures your data will be consistent and fit for purpose.

#### **3. [[Geospatial Practice/Establishing the Data Foundation/index|Establishing the Data Foundation]]**

Here, you acquire and prepare your data. Whether you're conducting fieldwork, downloading existing datasets, or digitising historical maps, every action is guided by your data model and meticulously documented in your Design Rationale.

#### **4. [[Geospatial Practice/Analytical Modelling/index|Analytical Modelling]]**

This is where you develop and execute analytical methods to answer your research questions. This is typically the key part of your GIS work and is a combination of intellectual design of processing pipelines that can convert your data to the desired results and software-specific knowledge of how to implement these pipelines.

#### **5. [[Geospatial Practice/Dissemination and Communication/index|Dissemination and Communication]]**

The final phase involves sharing your work. This includes not only your final maps and reports but the **Design Rationale itself**. By publishing your process, you empower others to understand, critique, and confidently build upon your findings, fostering a culture of open and reproducible science.


## Exploitative Workflow vs Prescriptive Workflow 
Note that the execution of the five phases is not 100 % linear like a [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) within SemanticGIS; there is considerable backflow from one phase to the previous.  This is especially the case if the "Project Scoping" has identified a "[[Geospatial Practice/Project Scoping/index#^Prescriptive-Workflow|Prescriptive Workflow]]"  where the project workflow is identified by reverse engineering the prescribed outputs.
