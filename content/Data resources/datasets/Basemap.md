A basemap is a data layer used to provide a backdrop of reference information for other layers in a GIS. It can either provide a geographical context for data visualisation or function as the basis for a visual interpretation for creating new data layers. Basemaps, typically [[Topographical maps]] including geographical features such as coastlines, major roads, and political boundaries, are areal(**[[Orthophoto]]**)/satellite imagery.
