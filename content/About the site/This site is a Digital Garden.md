## What is a digital garden?

A digital garden is an evolving, interconnected collection of notes, ideas, and resources designed to grow over time, much like a garden. Unlike traditional blogs or wikis, digital gardens emphasise non-linear exploration, allowing users to discover content through various pathways and connections. Each "plant" in the garden represents a topic or concept that is constantly being refined and expanded. This approach encourages continuous learning and knowledge building, making it ideal for organising complex, interrelated information in a way that's accessible and dynamic.

## Map of Contents (MOC)
In a digital garden, a "Map of Contents" (MOC) acts as a navigational tool that organises and links related notes, concepts, and resources together. Unlike traditional tables of contents, MOCs are dynamic and can be structured either flat or hierarchically, guiding users through different pathways of exploration. They serve as entry points or “maps” that help users understand the relationships between various topics, facilitating deeper dives into specific areas of interest. 

If you are ready to explore the garden, jump to one of the Maps of Content (MOCs) in the [[Map of Content Collection|collection]] or directly to one of the base MOCs
