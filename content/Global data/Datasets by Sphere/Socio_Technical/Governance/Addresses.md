## Global datasets
### [[OpenStreetMap]]. 
In OSM, addresses can be represented in different ways reflecting the regional traditions, see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Addresses.
In general there are two different approaches 
1. Addresses are addes as nodes with tag `addr:housenumber` 
2. Alternatively, the attribute can be assigned as an attribute to the building. Please note this can be confusing in situations wher there are several addresses (enterances and flats) in the same building 

## Global Geocodding services
There are several global codding services, such as Nominatim (Free and open source) and google. For non address based geocoding (translating named locations to geometry ) there is also the service  GeoNames
