A vertical datum is a reference surface used as a baseline to measure elevations or depths on the Earthâ€™s surface. It defines zero elevation and serves as a standard for measuring height (elevations) or depth (such as underwater depths). There are two main types of vertical datums:
- **Tidal Datum**
	**Dansk Normal Nul (DNN)**: A vertical datum used in Denmark based on mean sea level. It was historically used before being replaced by newer datums.
  
- **Geodetic Datum**
	**DVR90 (Danish Vertical Reference 1990)**: The current official vertical datum in Denmark, based on a precise geoid model.
