## Breaking Out of the Tutorial Trap
After creating hundreds and watching thousands of tutorials, I am not a great fan of classical tutorials. After watching and successfully completing a tutorial, the problem of transfer arises: how to transfer the knowledge from the tutorial to your domain and pondering over questions like why does this step not work with my data? a process that generates little knowledge. This site is an attempt to break out of this "Tutorial Trap" and support another mode of learning, namely the **Problem-Oriented Project Learning (POPL)** approach.
## Problem-Oriented Project Learning (POPL): Tackling Real-World GIS Challenges

Problem-Oriented Project Learning (POPL) is an educational approach where learning occurs through the active exploration of real-world problems and challenges. In the context of GIS, POPL ensures that learners not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also apply it to solve practical issues, which is especially important in topics that combine knowledge and skill, for as the wording goes, "In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice, there is."

## Steps in POPL based GIS learning
#### 1. **Identify Real-World Problems**

Start by identifying a real-world problem relevant to your interests or professional field. The problem should be complex enough to require a combination of GIS skills and critical thinking related to its domain. If you are following a course, this might be given through a specific assignment, but then at least try to tweak the assignment in your own direction.  

**Example:**
- **Urban Planning**: Assess the impact of new developments on green spaces in a city.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track changes in land use and their effects on local ecosystems.
- **Urban Design**: Redesign the lighting of an open space to make it feel more secure and ammoniated after dark.
#### 2. **Document Your Process and Design choices**

Keep detailed records of your project process and the decisions you make along the way. Maintaining  a so-called [[Design Rationale]] helps you and others understand the reasoning behind your methods and solutions. 


**Example:**
- Maintain a project journal where you note each step, the challenges you faced, and how you resolved them. Explain why you chose specific data sources, analysis methods, and visualisation techniques. Do not only document the data and methods you chose but also relevant alternatives and why you chose one in favour of another.
#### 3. **Define Clear Objectives**

Once you’ve identified a problem, define clear, achievable objectives for your project. These objectives should guide your research, data collection, and analysis.

**Example:**
- **Objective**: Create a GIS-based analysis to identify areas in the city that lack access to green spaces and propose new locations for parks.

#### 4. **Break Down the Project into Manageable Tasks**

Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks. This approach helps you stay organised and makes the project manageable.

**Example:**
- **Tasks**:
  - Collect spatial data on existing green spaces.
  - Analyse population density and distribution.
  - Identify areas with insufficient green space.
  - Propose new park locations and create maps to illustrate your findings.
This step is the hardest one. I highly recommend that you do this iteratively by deconstructing your objectives into smaller conceptual steps, and first, when you have a theoretical understanding of how your objective can be achieved, then, you can start by investigating what data exists or needs to be collected and which GIS operations can be used. A trick for this latter part is to use an AI-based chatbot as ChatGPT to help in the translation from conceptual operations to specific GIS operations. you could for instance prompt ChatGPT:
```
Given that I have a dataset of addresses and green areas, how can I use QGIS to identify areas lacking access to green areas?
```
The better theoretical understanding of your objectives, the better you can prompt the chatbot. You could refine the previous prompt by adding. 
```
My goal is to ensure that all people have asses to at least 2500 square meters of green area within 10 minutes walk.
```

#### 5. **Engage in Active Learning**

Active learning involves directly engaging with the material rather than passively consuming information. Work hands-on with GIS tools and software, applying what you’ve learned to your project.

**Example:**
- Use QGIS or ArcGIS to analyse spatial data, create layers, and generate maps that address your project objectives.

#### 6. **Collaborate and Seek Feedback**

Collaboration and feedback are essential components of POPL. Working with peers and seeking input from mentors or experts can provide new insights and improve your project’s quality.

**Example:**
- Share your project with classmates or colleagues for feedback.
- Participate in online GIS communities to get input from experienced professionals.

#### 7. **Reflect and Iterate**

Reflection is a critical part of the learning process. After completing your project, take time to reflect on what you’ve learned, what worked well, and what could be improved. Use this reflection to iterate and refine your skills.

**Example:**
- After finishing your green space analysis project, write a reflection on the challenges you encountered with data accuracy and how you addressed them. Consider how you could improve your methodology in future projects.



#### Digital Garden: Learn What You Need, When You Need It

Think of our site as a digital garden. It’s a space where ideas grow and connect organically. Instead of following a rigid path, you can start with a specific problem you need to solve and explore the concepts as they relate to that problem. Here’s what makes it special:

* **Non-Linear Learning**: Jump in wherever it makes sense for you. Need to solve a specific issue? Start there and see where it takes you.
* **Interconnected Notes**: Explore topics through a web of interconnected notes and resources, making it easy to dive deeper as needed.
* **Personal Growth**: Cultivate your knowledge over time, adding to your understanding bit by bit.
