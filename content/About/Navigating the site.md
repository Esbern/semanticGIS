There are basically 5 ways to navigate the site:
- The 'Organising a GIS project' article will guide you step by step through the GIS project, with links to materials relevant for each step. 
- Using the search area in the top left
- Use  "Explorer" under the search field gives the ability to navigate the folder structure of the site. This approach is not recommended unless you are navigating to a topic you know where is located. (the folder location is also available as a breadcrumb over the note title)
- Tags: The tags associated with a note are listed under the note title. Clicking a tag will list all other notes with that tag
- Graph View (at the top right) shows a graph of the note and all other notes/tags with links to it.
